## 1.4

```{r fig.width = 12}
BernGrid(rep(0,5), 
         prior = ~triangle::dtriangle(.x, 0, 1, 1)^3) |
  BernGrid(rep(0,10), 
         prior = ~triangle::dtriangle(.x, 0, 1, 1)^3) |
  BernGrid(rep(0,30), 
         prior = ~triangle::dtriangle(.x, 0, 1, 1)^3) 
```

From this example, the prior is constant among the three plots. The more data inputted into the plot, the less normal the posterior curve becomes. Each triangle distribution has a center value of 1, so the more 0's are inputted, the more the posterior probability moves away from 1. 

## 1.5

```{r fig.width = 12, fig.height = 7}
dfoo <- function(p) {
  0.02 * dunif(p) + 
    0.49 * triangle::dtriangle(p, 0.1, 0.2) + 
    0.49 * triangle::dtriangle(p, 0.8, 0.9)
}
BernGrid(c(rep(0, 3), rep(1, 3)), prior = dfoo) /
  BernGrid(c(rep(0, 10), rep(1, 10)),  prior = dfoo) |
  BernGrid(c(rep(0, 30), rep(1, 30)),  prior = dfoo) /
  BernGrid(c(rep(0, 100), rep(1, 100)), prior = dfoo)
```
Each grid has an equal amount of 0's and 1's as the data, so the posterior is always centered at 0.5. The more data there are, the less it shapes to the triangle distributions in the prior. 


## 1.6 

```{r fig.width = 12, fig.height = 7}
dfoo <- function(p) {
  0.02 * dunif(p) + 
    0.49 * triangle::dtriangle(p, 0.1, 0.2) + 
    0.49 * triangle::dtriangle(p, 0.8, 0.9)
}
BernGrid(c(rep(0, 3), rep(1, 4)), prior = dfoo) /
  BernGrid(c(rep(0, 10), rep(1, 11)),  prior = dfoo) /
  BernGrid(c(rep(0, 30), rep(1, 31)),  prior = dfoo) |
  BernGrid(c(rep(0, 4), rep(1, 3)), prior = dfoo) /
  BernGrid(c(rep(0, 11), rep(1, 10)),  prior = dfoo) /
  BernGrid(c(rep(0, 31), rep(1, 30)),  prior = dfoo)
```
Similar to the last set of plots, the less data there are, the more it fits to the triangle distribution shapes. The data in those plots had an equal amount of 0's and 1's, though, as this one is just barely unequal. The posterior probability is always skewed to the left or right depending on where the majority of the values in the data are. Ex: in the first plot, there are more 1's in the dataset, making the posterior probability for that data closer to the triangle distribution ranging from 0.8 to 0.9, and the probability is also highest in that range as well. 

## 2.2 

### a)

There are `r nrow(KidsFeet)` observations in the KidsFeet dataset. 

### b)

```{r}
glimpse(KidsFeet)
```

There are 4 variables that are factors: name, sex, biggerfoot, and domhand

### c)

```{r}
KidsFeet <- KidsFeet %>%
  mutate(foot_ratio = length / width) %>%
  mutate(biggerfoot2 = case_when(
    domhand == biggerfoot ~ "dom",
    domhand != biggerfoot ~ "nondom"
  ))
head(KidsFeet)
```

### d)

```{r}
Boys <- KidsFeet %>%
  filter(sex == "B")
head(Boys)
```

### e) 

```{r}
largestFootSize <- Boys %>%
  arrange(desc(foot_ratio))
head(largestFootSize, 1)
```

David has the largest foot ratio at 2.90

## 3.1

### a)

```{r}
p <- function(x) {
  return(6*x*(1-x))
}
```

### b)

```{r}
gf_function(fun = p, xlim = c(-0.5, 1.5))
```

### c)

```{r, out.height = '50%', out.width= '75%', fig.align= "center"}
knitr::include_graphics('integral.png')
```

### d) 

```{r}
integrate(p, lower = 0, upper = 1)
```

### e) 

The largest value of p(x) = 0, which can be obtained with both x = 0 and x = 1. This value is not larger than 1. 


## 3.4

```{r}
vars <- c(10, 13)
var(vars)
tigerstats::pnormGC(c(7,13),region="between",mean=10,
        sd=4.5,graph=TRUE)
```
To get an area of 0.5, in between the x values 7 and 13, we use the variance of 10 and 13, which is 4.5. 

## 3.6

### a)

$P(Hat A | 2white) = 0.4 * 0.4 = 0.16$

### b)

$P(Hat A | 1red 1yellow) = 0.48 * 0.2 = 0.096$

### c)

$P(Hat A | 2white) = 0.16$

$P(Hat A | 2red) = 0.48 * 0.48 = 0.2304$

$P(Hat A | 2yellow) = 0.2 * 0.2 = 0.04$

$P(Hat A | same color) = P(Hat A | 2white) + P(Hat A | 2red) + P(Hat A | 2yellow)$

$P(Hat A | same color) = 0.16 + 0.2304 + 0.04$

$P(Hat A | same color) = 0.4304$
